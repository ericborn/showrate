# showrate

My organization had a relatively high no-show rate, 20-40% of appointments, so I wanted to put together a data study to attempt to identify factors that may indicate whether they would show to a doctor's appointment or not.
   
Utilizing both SQL and R, I evaluated various factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, type of appointment, appointment day of the week and time and the number of days between the creation of appointment and actual appointment date. The study was performed on over 500K patients and the various factors weighted against each other for importance. 

Once these were determined, a risk model was developed and applied to all future appointment in an attempt to predict how many no-shows there would be and overbook where necessary to keep the clinics at capacity.
